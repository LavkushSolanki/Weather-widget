# Weather-widget
### About
This is my first react app project where I use API to fetch information regrading the weather and used this information to display various informations like
+ Temperature(Maximum and Minimum),Wind Speed
- Feels Like
* **Also I tried to display what clothes we can wear when we go out in this weather (Add On from my side)**
### Learning
+ I learned about various features of react like how to build components,send props,managing states.
- I learned about material ui and used it in my project.
